# Extraction writes what the document says

Extraction turns a chunk into open statements. This file says what it reads, what it writes, what it
refuses, and how it is measured. Records: [0044] (the contract), [0039] and [0040] (the chunk it
sees, in [sources](sources.md)), [0041] (names), [0001] (drop signals), [0015] (memory documents),
and the superseded typed contract of [0006], [0012], [0031], [0037]. Cut 1 landed in #731, memory
documents joined in #735, and the typed path is deleted in #736.

## What it does today

**Input.** One call per chunk, at temperature 0, with the document's filename, the things already
accepted earlier in the document, the document's opening (its first 1,500 characters, #680) and the
chunk text. No ontology, no document date, no request for dates [0044 d2, #731]. The chunk is the
whole context: what its boundary cut away cannot be recovered by the prompt, so the chunker's rules
are extraction's rules [0039].

**Output, the compact contract** (`utopia_extract::open`). `e`: things, each a name or a
description, the document's kind word, and whether it is named or described. `s`: statements, each
opening with its own verbatim quote and then naming its subject and object in words, the relation
phrase as written, an object name or a literal value, qualifiers keyed by the document's role
words, and `when` / `ended` time words. `n`: other names the document gives a thing. Statements name their sides in words
and carry their own quote because a numbered contract mixed the ids up on dense passages (misworded
10 to 14% with ids, 2 to 7% with names) [#731]. Parsing is per item: a malformed item is counted and
a truncated reply is repaired to its last complete item.

**What is a thing, what is a statement** [#743, prior-work items 1 and 6]. A thing is named when its
name is a proper name or a fixed term, one that means the same thing in any document (a person, an
organization, a product, a place, a document, a law, an event; a disease, a drug, an industry, a
product category, an indicator); it is described when it is a role or a generic phrase whose
referent the passage decides ("the company", "patients", "各部门"), however particular it is
there. Named things resolve across documents by name [0041]; described things exist only in their
document and only when a statement points at them. A phrase is the verb with the words that belong
to it, so that subject, phrase and object read as a sentence on their own, never a bare verb cut
from a longer verb phrase; several verbs sharing one object are one statement, one verb with several
objects is one statement per object. The object is what the verb acts on; where, how, why, with
what and for whom go in qualifiers under the passage's own role word, a named thing mentioned there
is still listed and the qualifier names it, and a generic phrase that appears only there stays
words in the qualifier. In a table, a cell is a statement about its row's thing whose phrase is
the column heading; when the heading names a time it is `when` instead, the statement is about
the thing the caption names and the phrase is the row label with its section path, and a unit the
caption gives is a qualifier [#744]. A statement the passage requires, plans, expects, forecasts
or makes conditional carries a qualifier keyed `mood` whose value is the passage's own words for
that ("要", "should", "will", "is expected to"); a verb that reports (announced, said) is not a
mood; the phrase stays as written, and alignment never materializes a statement with a mood as a
typed fact [#745]. A rule that gave a subjectless sentence the passage's addressee or speaker as
its subject was tried and withdrawn in the same change: under it the model returned nothing for
a fifth of the chunks of a filing, tables included, and the bullets of a release already take the
company as their subject without it. These are contract rules, not server checks: the shape
checks below look at structure, never at vocabulary.

**What a call to the endpoint survives** [#757]. Extraction, both aligners and time resolution
share one retry: a failure that fixes itself is waited out (five tries, backing off to a minute,
honouring `Retry-After`), anything else is raised. Four kinds fix themselves: the endpoint rate
limits, it answers 408, 502, 503 or 504, the request never reaches it, or its stream stops in the
middle of an answer. A 500 does not, because that can be the endpoint's own bug, and neither does a
read timeout: the ceiling is 300 seconds of silence and retrying that five times is 25 minutes.

The call is streamed and the answer assembled, so that the timeout measures silence rather than
thinking. Not streamed, the first byte waits for the whole answer, so with reasoning on the model's
thinking counts as silence: one dense passage of a filing crossed 300 seconds three times and was
declared dead, while the same passage streamed has bytes at 2.6 seconds and finishes at 231. It is
not faster, it is only honest about what silence means. A stream that ends without `[DONE]` or a
`finish_reason` is a failure and not a short answer, because half an answer is a valid string and
the statements it lost would go unmentioned. A chunk that still cannot be extracted is a drop row
(`chunk_unextracted`), so the gap survives the document being marked done.

**What a reasoning cap costs.** Thinking is where the time goes: on a dense 1,310-character passage
the model spends 33,000 reasoning tokens and 1,500 on the answer. Of the ways to ask for less, this
endpoint honours `reasoning_effort`, whose low setting halves the thinking (15.5k and 16.5k
reasoning tokens against 33k and 35k at medium, 32k and 29.5k at high, 33k with the field left out).
It ignores `thinking.budget_tokens`, `reasoning.max_tokens` and `max_tokens`: a call
capped at 4,096 returned 45,428 completion tokens and finished normally.

Run end to end on the same four filings, the same 14 classes and 28 properties and the same 55
chunks, the low setting is a quarter quicker per chunk (150 seconds to 115) and costs on every other
axis: 885 open statements become 729, figures in tables that reach no statement go from 2% to 16%
and in prose from 0% to 3%, quotes that do not occur in the chunk go from 46 to 107, and the judge
reads 6.9% of statements as misworded against 3.7%, where judging the same graph twice moves the
number by 1.4. **The lever is measured and left alone.** The read timeout it was meant to answer is
already answered by streaming.

**Where a long answer stops** [#760]. The extraction and alignment calls send an explicit
`max_tokens` of 65,536. Without it the ceiling is whatever the endpoint defaults to: with reasoning
disabled a dense passage's answer stopped at exactly 4,096 completion tokens with
`finish_reason: length`, and that JSON could not be parsed.

The number is measured against the completion, not against the answer, because `max_tokens` does not
mean the same thing everywhere: Anthropic counts thinking inside it and OpenAI's
`max_completion_tokens` counts reasoning tokens. On an endpoint that counts reasoning, a ceiling
chosen to fit the answer would be a budget for the thinking instead, and that is the lever measured
and rejected under **What a reasoning cap costs** above: holding this model to about 16,000 reasoning
tokens cost 885 statements against 729, and took table figures reaching no statement from 2% to 16%.
The largest completion measured on this path is 45,428 tokens, so 65,536 sits above it and can only
ever guard against the endpoint's own default. The answer itself is about 1,500 tokens, nowhere near
either line.

Sending it is not a guarantee. The same endpoint ignores the field with reasoning on, where a call
capped at 4,096 returned 45,428 completion tokens and finished normally; it is honoured with
reasoning off, which is where the truncation was seen. The field costs nothing where it is not read.

`finish_reason` travels with the answer rather than being dropped once the stream is known to have
ended, because a reply cut at the ceiling is a valid string and looks complete to the parser. With
the reason carried through, a chunk that hits the ceiling says so — the drop row reads *hit the
token ceiling* instead of only *could not be parsed* — and the two causes stay apart: an answer that
is too long is a number to change, a reply that does not fit the shape is not. Across all bases in
the e2e database `truncated_reply` has fired 10 times, and those rows keep every complete item.

**Server checks, each a drop reason in `extraction_drops`.** Every quote must occur in the chunk
(`quote_not_in_chunk`); every name in its quote (`name_not_in_text`); a time mention only when its
words occur in the statement's own quote (`time_not_in_quote`), because the model otherwise attaches
one time to unrelated sentences; every subject must be a listed thing (`unknown_ref`); an unlisted
object becomes a literal value with a signal (`object_undeclared`); a string one entity already
claims in the document is not a name of another (`name_claimed_by_another`). Offsets are computed on
the server by locating the quote, never taken from the model. The remaining codes are
`malformed_item`, `truncated_reply` and `object_missing`; a phrase that is the value itself or the
subject's own name is kept and counted (`phrase_is_value`, `phrase_is_subject`, the two shapes a
model writes for a table row that lost its heading or its caption; the subject and the value are
there, so nothing is lost, #744); the 28 codes of the typed path went with it [#736]. A drop is a
row, never silence; the table is cleared per document when extraction starts
and shown per document in the Library, apart from Review [0001, 0005].

**What it writes** (see [ledger](ledger.md)). Open statements as `facts` rows with `layer = 'open'`,
the phrase, no predicate and no `valid_*`; `statement_qualifiers` keyed by role word;
`time_mentions` as verbatim words with an offset; evidence with `quote_start` / `quote_end`; a
described thing as an entity with `description` and no name fact; name facts on `known_as` [0041];
`attested_at` from the document's date only when that date came from the content or a dating
source, never the upload time (#714). Dedup is on (base, subject, phrase, object), which closes the
NULL-predicate dedup hole of [0010].

**What it skips.** The ontology lists and per-chunk retrieval, predicate matching, the temporal
reconcile, signature checks, type resolution and ontology bootstrap [#731, #736]. Identity still
runs per handle (`resolve_handle`, namesake reviews, the govern and adjudicate enqueues); a chunk of
origin `described` keeps its confidence ceiling [0040]. Until alignment, a base holds open
statements and no typed facts, so timelines, conflicts and signature queues stay empty.

**Memory documents** take the same path; their statements wait in `pending_facts` with phrase,
qualifiers, time words and quote span, and a nod writes an open statement [0015, #735].

## Why

- **Statements in the document's words are faithful**: 0 of 333 not stated and 2% misworded in the
  prototype, against 4 to 9% not stated when bound at write time [0044].
- **No ontology in the prompt**: binding happens per signature and the ontology grows with use; a
  1,010-class ontology cost 108k tokens a chunk and made the model choose worse [0044, 0006].
- **No dates from the model**: arithmetic inside the model leaves no trace, and "today" resolved
  against the upload day; time is words now and an interpretation later [0045, #714].
- **Code checks structure, never vocabulary.** A name is kept because it is in the text, not because
  a list says it is a name; the same rule for quotes and time words [0041, 0044 d8].
- **A described thing is an entity** and gets no name fact, so a description never bridges two
  documents [#731].
- **Named sides and per-statement quotes** cost tokens and buy the not-stated rate [#731]; the
  quote comes first so the statement is written from the copied sentence [Huang 2024,
  prior-work item 9, #748].
- **Every drop is a row** because an append-only ledger with evidence on every fact cannot drop
  silently [0001].
- **Temperature 0** because the endpoint default swung one paragraph between 8 and 31 statements
  [#731].

## Benches and thresholds

`scripts/bench/recall.mjs` (SEC filings, pharma, ai-timeline; Re-DocRED fetched by script and never
used as prompt examples) scores entity-pair recall; `judge_open.mjs` has a judge model read the
chunk and reports stated, misworded and not stated, then in a second pass marks each misworded
statement extrapolated (it goes beyond what the document gives the pair) or contradicted (the
document says otherwise: direction, phrase or the value of another cell) [prior-work item 8, #749],
and separately whether the statement reads on its own without the document (`alone`, the uninformative-phrase class of [prior-work](prior-work.md)
item 1); `identity.mjs`, `govern.mjs`, `temporal.mjs`
and the lease bench cover the other domains. The judge's own variance is measured: the same 909
statements judged twice came out misworded 5.0% and 3.6% with 97% of verdicts identical, and
reads-alone 4.8%, 8.6% and 10.7% across three passes, so a difference under two points of misworded
between two runs is noise and reads-alone is reported but not compared between single runs [#749].
**Extraction has its own spread, measured the same way**: the four filings extracted twice under one
configuration give 885 and 824 statements, misworded 3.7% and 4.2%, not stated 0.0% and 0.2%,
figures in tables reaching no statement 2% and 4%. A run moves the statement count by about seven
per cent and misworded by half a point, so the two spreads together are what a claim has to clear.
`figures.mjs` counts every figure a passage writes against every statement drawn from that passage,
reads no model, and separates table rows from prose; the judge counts a statement once per piece of
evidence, so its denominator is statement-evidence pairs rather than statements (845 against 824 on
the second run). Every cut reports at least three domains, two runs per configuration,
with the judge's calibration stated; no F1 against Re-DocRED, whose gold omits true
facts [0044]. Thresholds: not stated at most 2%, entity-pair recall no lower than before, prompt
tokens per document reported. Measured at cut 1: not stated at or under 2% in 16 of 18
corpus-rounds; NVDA full documents 44 to 46 of 52 (one standard deviation about 2.7) against 43 and
45 before [#731, 0039].

## Superseded

The typed contract: the ontology laid out under a 24,000-character budget or retrieved per chunk
with ancestor completion [0006]; `[event]` / `[eternal]` marks and the zoned-time sentence [0031,
0024]; qualifiers listed after a relation and keyed by a declared attribute [0037]; direction
corrected by signature at write time [0012]; `specific_type` and `proposed_type` for type
resolution [0001]; the model's `relative` flag on a deadline [0022]; the word lists for entity names
and clauses [0012]. The ledger rules those records made stand (see [ledger](ledger.md)).

## Proposed and not built

- Identity profiles [0044 d6]; a layer marker in the interface (an open row renders as an unnamed
  relation labelled by its phrase). Alignment producing typed facts [0044 cut 2] and time
  interpretation against the document [0045 cuts 1 to 3] were on this list and are built.
- A second pass asking which figures and dates are not yet in a statement (dense sentences drop the
  amount); the period column of a financial-table cell [#729].
- The errata agent over the typed graph [0044 d7] was on this list and is built: see
  [design/ontology](ontology.md).

## Open questions

- Chinese chunks get less context at 300 tokens than at 1,200 characters; unmeasured [0039].
- Whether a stated observation should raise the confidence of a fact first seen in a description
  [0040].
- Recall of facts that need more than one sentence waits for derivation rules [0044].
