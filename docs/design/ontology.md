# The ontology is a view over what documents say

The ontology is the vocabulary a base answers questions in: classes, relations, attributes and their
declarations. This file says where that vocabulary comes from, how it is governed, and how it binds
to what documents say. Records: [0001], [0003], [0006], [0007], [0008], [0009], [0012], [0036],
[0037], [0044]. The review side of proposals is in [governance](governance.md), the schema side of
mappings in [lakehouse-and-actions](lakehouse-and-actions.md), the extraction contract in
[extraction](extraction.md).

## What it does today

**Three layers, and "ontology" names one of them.** The open graph holds what documents say:
entities with their names and type words, statements whose relation is the document's phrase,
qualifiers, time mentions and quotes. The ontology holds object types, link types and properties,
each with a definition, examples and regression cases, plus constraints, versioned on the recorded
axis. The typed graph holds facts expressed in the ontology, computed from the open graph and marked
with the ontology version it was computed under [0044]. Since 2026-09-16 extraction writes the open
graph and nothing else (#731, #736); the ontology enters no extraction prompt; typed facts will come
only from alignment (0044 cut 2, not built). A base extracted today holds open statements and name
facts and no typed facts, so signature checks, timelines and proposals have nothing to read until
alignment lands.

**The tables.** `entity_types` and `relation_types` (`kind` is relation or attribute),
`entity_type_parents` for multiple inheritance with one primary parent for the tree view,
`relation_type_domains` / `relation_type_ranges` checked through the subclass DAG,
`entity_type_disjoint`, `inverseOf` and `subPropertyOf`, the `functional` and `inverse_functional`
flags, `temporal` (state, event, eternal) on every relation, `datatype` and `unit` on attributes,
and `relation_type_qualifiers` naming the attributes an edge of that relation may carry
[0001, 0031, 0037]. A class or relation imported from a vocabulary keeps its IRI (`UNIQUE (kb_id,
iri)`) and the export writes that IRI back; `key` (`[a-z0-9_]`, at most 40 characters) is the token
the API uses, unique per base [0001, 0020].

**Where a vocabulary comes from.** A new base is empty: no classes, no relations, and no pack unless
the person ticks one in the creation dialog [0008, 0009]. Five packs ship inside the binary
(schema.org, W3C Org, PROV-O, FOAF, IOF Core), multi-select, reconciled by a static alignment table
of about twenty rows, additive and without undo [0008]. An OWL file (Turtle or RDF/XML) is stored
verbatim in the blob store and projected into the tables by a re-runnable derivation that reports
what it did not project; a dry run precedes every import; individuals are never imported as facts
[0001]. The rest is typed on the ontology page or adopted from a proposal. The self-check of [0002]
runs after an import: eight defect kinds (a relation both symmetric and asymmetric, a subclass cycle,
an inverse that does not point back) are shown before any fact-level check, and a base without axioms
reports zero.

**A type on an entity is optional and a person's decision is final.** `entities.type_id` is
nullable; NULL means undecided, and `type_source` (extracted, human, inferred) keeps a person's
retype, including "no type", out of every automatic path [0009, 0001]. Same-name entities may coexist
across types and untyped [0009]. Type resolution (candidates from class descriptions and from the
classes of context neighbours, interleaved and never scored together; a class inside the current
subtree applied on its own, a cross-axis class sent to a person, each pair acknowledged once) runs
from the ontology page; extraction no longer enqueues it [0001, 0016, #736].

**One statement draws one edge** [#755]. The typed graph is a view, so the canvas and the entity
panel show one edge per statement: the property's name when a live typed row was computed from it,
the document's phrase when none was. The document's wording is not lost with the folded edge, it
rides on the typed one (`said_as`, the phrases of every statement behind that row) and the interface
shows it. Both rows stay in the ledger; this is a rule about the picture, not about what is kept.

**A relation phrase binds to a property per signature** [0044 cut 2, #751]. A signature is a
phrase as the documents wrote it, the class of its subject and the class of its object, or "value"
when the object is a figure, a title or a status; the classes come from the kind-word bindings, and
a side whose kind word is bound to no class is its own signature. Each signature is decided once,
after the kind words, by the same shape as [#741]: candidates are the properties whose declared
domain and range admit the two ends in either direction (an undeclared end admits anything), the
model sees the signature with three of its statements and their quotes, and two votes with the
candidates in opposite orders must agree on the property and the direction (forward when the
statement's subject is the property's subject, reverse when its object is) for the signature to
bind. A signature the votes disagree on is `undecided` for the alignment queue of #725; one with no
fitting property is `none`, its statements stay in the open graph and it counts toward the
workbench's suggestions. Bindings live in `phrase_bindings`. Candidates are the properties whose
declared domain and range admit the endpoint classes **or an ancestor of them**, and a candidate
that fits only by inheritance says so to the model. A decision stores a fingerprint of what it
considered (both ancestor closures, the admitted candidates with their `updated_at`); it is stale
when the fingerprint of the current inputs differs, which is what timestamps could not see: a
parent edge added or removed, an edit committed while the model was answering [0053, #807, #795].
A signature with no admissible property is recorded as `none` (its projection retires); one with
more candidates than the limit is `undecided` for the queue, not silently skipped. Kind-word
bindings still use `updated_at`, so cosmetic edits can also trigger their reevaluation.

**A shape of statement can imply a fact of another property** [0044 decision 3, migration 0073].
An implication rule is keyed like a binding (a signature) or by a kind word, names the property it
concludes, and takes its object from the statement's own object or from a *reading* of the object's
words: the country a demonym names, the country a place lies in, the year a phrase gives. The
aligner proposes rules once per decided signature and once per kind word (a "nothing implied"
answer is recorded so it is not asked again until the basis changes); a person approves or rejects
them on the alignment queue, and the decision commits with its job. Readings are asked of the model
once per distinct phrase by the `read_phrases` job and cached in `phrase_readings`, including "no
answer"; materialisation never calls a model — it reads the cache, writes the implied facts with the
triggering statement's evidence, marks them `implied` (the export carries the flag), and retires
them by source like any other typed row.

**An errata agent reviews the typed graph after extraction** [0044 decision 7, migration 0074]. Once
materialisation has written new rows, the `errata_review` job takes each document with typed facts
nobody has looked at and sends them to the model with the document, the ontology's properties and,
for each fact, the structural flag it earned: `domain` or `range` (an end outside the property's
declared kinds, through the class hierarchy), `name_absent` (a name that does not occur in the
document), `no_date` (a date property holding something that is not a date). Flagged facts go
first, the rest is sampled, and a document gets a budget of two requests. The model answers a JSON
action protocol — keep, retract, revise, or add once every given fact is answered — and every
retract, revise and add must quote the document's own words; a quote that is not in the document,
a name that is not in the base or a property that does not exist is recorded as refused and never
applied (the agent creates nothing). Each verdict is a row in `errata_actions`, keep included, so
a fact is reviewed once. An action passes the 0027 gate before it touches the graph: a fact with a
derived fact resting on it or whose subject was named in an answer, or a write that would give a
one-value property two values, is held for a person on the errata queue of the Review page, where
the card shows the document, the proposed change, the quote and the reason it was held. A
retraction sticks: materialisation and implication skip a (statement, property) pair an applied
errata action retracted or revised, while another document's statement of the same thing still
materialises. `errata_runs` keeps the per-document account (facts flagged and sampled, requests,
the endpoint's token usage) for the measure 0044 names: precision gained against correct facts
removed, at what cost.

Even one edit can reopen all older automatic negative bindings on that side of the
base, requiring two votes per eligible item through batched model requests; debouncing reduces
the number of runs, not the items reconsidered. A burst of ontology edits debounces into one run
rather than one run each [#757];
a person's decision is never overwritten by the agent. A person's phrase decision commits together
with its own recomputation job and the request answers `202` with the job id; the typed graph is
recomputed by that job, never by the request, and the page learns of it through the `review` and
`graph` events or `GET /kbs/{id}/jobs/{job_id}` [0051]. On
the 25-document batch with a hand-written ontology of 14 classes and 28 properties, and 60 of
400 kind words bound, 423 signatures cover 861 statements: 36 bind (184 statements), 110 bind to
nothing, 1 splits the votes and 276 have no admissible property because an end is unbound; a
judge reading the chunk finds 95% of the resulting typed facts stated by the document, 4% worded
wrongly and 1% not stated. Offering every property to an unbound end raised coverage to 85
signatures and dropped the judge to 87%, and on the NVDA releases, where 15 of 230 kind words
bind, to 59%: the generic "value" attribute swallowed every cash-flow row. Coverage therefore
follows the kind-word bindings and the ontology's size, not the binder. What still goes wrong is
a phrase that carries part of the value ("下降 1.4%" bound to a change property loses its sign)
and a table section read as a change ("changes in operating assets › accounts payable").

**A bound statement is a typed fact** [0044 cut 2, #752]. The typed graph is computed, never
written by hand: after each phrase-alignment run, every live open statement under a bound signature
becomes one `layer = 'typed'` row whose predicate is the bound property, whose ends follow the
binding's direction, and whose value, world-axis interval, attestation and confidence are copied
from the statement; its evidence rows and role-word qualifiers are copied too, and
`from_statement_id` points back at the statement. A statement with a `mood` qualifier is never
materialised. The computation is a set operation and idempotent: rows whose source no longer holds
(the statement invalidated, the signature no longer bound, the property or direction changed) are
invalidated, rows that are due and missing are added, rows whose binding is unchanged keep their
id, evidence and recorded time. Several statements that produce the same triple give one row: the row is written through
the typed graph's own gate (the dedup, time refinement and closing rules of `insert_fact`), and
`typed_fact_sources` lists every statement behind it, so a row is retired only when none of its
sources holds [#753]. On the 25-document batch the 36 bound signatures give 184 typed rows.

**Argument order is enforced, participation is guided.** A declared domain or range shapes
candidates and never discards a fact; argument order is the key's encoding convention, so a fact
whose subject violates the domain while the object fits is swapped by the signature and marked
`direction_corrected` [0012]. The write-time swap left with the typed extraction path; what remains
is `ontology::judge_direction` on adoption (a predicate that fits neither way is left off) and on
merge (moved facts are re-checked and reported as `signature` violations) [0012, #736]. Under
alignment a signature's direction is decided once per signature [0044].

**Growth from the corpus.** Predicate words that matched nothing accumulate as proposals with their
counts; adoption is decided by counting (`MIN_DOCS = 2`, and `MIN_SIGNALS = 3` for an LLM run),
grouped by inflectional base, named by the most frequent phrasing, folded onto an existing
equivalent (`_by` inverses included) with subject and object swapped; the waiting facts are
rewritten as superseding rows, undoable per batch; dismissal is remembered and counting goes on; no
axiom is ever set automatically [0003, 0007]. The loop reads typed rows only, so an open phrase is
never auto-adopted, and with the typed path gone it receives no new input until alignment [#731,
#736]. `Metric` and `Dimension` are to retire: exploration inserts no class without a proposal
[0036, 0009].

**Language.** `label` is data and follows no switch; `key` is never translated; `description` follows
`knowledge_bases.ontology_lang` because it was the line the model read [0004]. With no ontology in
the prompt, a description is read by people and by the aligner.

## Why

- **Keep the original, project what has a consumer.** Discarding is irreversible; a projection can
  be redone when a consumer appears, so "not expressible" becomes "not yet projected" [0001].
- **IRI is identity, key is the token.** A key derived from a label breaks on relabel and collides
  across vocabularies; an IRI is a name and never an address [0001].
- **A declaration can be wrong** (`part_of` marked functional produced 59 false conflicts), so types
  guide and never gate; order is not a claim about the world, so it is enforced, measured 57% to 4%
  violations with reversals 39 to 0 [0001, 0012].
- **A placeholder in the ontology is control flow written as vocabulary.** `concept`, `related_to`,
  `mapped_to` and then `Metric` / `Dimension` were removed on the same argument; an undecided thing
  stays empty and readable [0009, 0010, 0011, 0036].
- **Packs give direction through structure**, which prose cannot; but a pack gives types, not
  predicates (81% of facts unbound before bootstrap), costs ten points of type accuracy to omit and
  buys an ontology in the corpus's own words, so none is the default [0008].
- **Counting decides adoption** because the model skipped `runs_on` (8 documents) and adopted a
  one-document verb, and a deterministic ontology makes the bench comparable; the model keeps only
  synonym merging, and merges stay human [0007, 0003].
- **Knowledge vetoes deleting ontology**: a type with entities cannot be deleted, so an import has
  no undo, only a bulk view of empty classes (not built) [0008].
- **A qualifier definition is an attribute definition** with a relation as its domain; a parallel
  type system was refused [0037].
- **The ontology is a view.** Facts bound at write time were induced by the property list (an award
  written as a genre): 4 to 9% not stated against 0 of 333 open statements; binding after the fact
  per signature costs distinct phrasings, not documents, and a changed ontology recomputes only the
  affected signatures instead of re-extracting [0044].
- **Standard vocabularies reify events as classes**, so every pack object property is a state; a
  person changes `temporal` on the page and reads pick it up at once [0031].

## Proposed and not built

- **Alignment** (0044 cut 2), the rest: a signature that tells a figure from words on the value
  side; the parity run against the withdrawn bound pass on the typed-graph bench (#880). The prototype aligner reached 14.7% and
  12.1% of gold recall in two runs against 15.5% for the withdrawn bound pass, so the bar for cut 2
  is parity over two clean runs [0044, #729].
- **The workbench** (0044 cut 5): the ontology page fed by suggestions from the open graph (frequent
  unbound signatures, type words in use, an ontology agent reading them against competency
  questions), by imported files, and by editing; every approved element carries regression cases;
  duplicate properties merged as governance.
- **Exploration proposes an alignment per table** through `ontology_proposals`, adopted as one
  thing; `Metric` / `Dimension` retire (#554, #556) [0036].
- Filtering reified-shell relations (`Action`, `Offer`) out of pack import [0012]; Chinese
  descriptions generated per `ontology_lang` [0016 C3]; a bulk view of an import's empty classes
  [0008].

## Open questions

- What becomes of `ontology_misses`, predicate adoption, type resolution and the bootstrap job once
  alignment lands: #736 leaves them idle; #725 proposes retiring the type machinery and adoption
  from `proposed_predicate` in favour of the ontology agent.
- Competency questions for a base that has none; when the typed graph is materialised eagerly
  [0044].
- Mixed-pack accuracy, Chinese labels on an English pack, and what a 1,500-term start does to
  adoption thresholds never retuned [0008, 0007]; narrative verbs and `_by` folding [0007].
