# 0036 · Exploration aligns a schema to the ontology

- **Status**: written · decision 7 implemented (#553 → #561: the schema document is
  indexed and never extracted, `sources.config.extract`, `graph_status = skipped`; the
  column-name entities went from 93 to 12 on the wide bench base) · a definition can be
  written by hand (#562 → #563), the door the seeded upper bound simulated · the
  conventions-as-prose dead end was measured at 14/18 and revised in place (see Dead ends) ·
  cuts remaining: #554 alignment, #555 the conversion tree, #556 retiring the two classes ·
  overturns where a mapping hangs, and keeps what [0011](0011-a-mapping-is-not-a-fact.md)
  said about what a mapping is · the two builtin classes `metric` / `dimension` are to
  retire (their revision notes are on 0009 and 0011) · the migration that carries the
  exploration ledger (#503) is unaffected
- **Written**: 2026-09-09 (conventions in the [README](README.md))
- **Related**: [0011](0011-a-mapping-is-not-a-fact.md) moved a mapping out of the ledger and
  is right that it is configuration; this record moves the *concept* out of the entity table.
  [0009](0009-no-type-is-a-type.md), [0010](0010-no-relation-is-no-relation.md) and 0011 are
  one line of work, control flow leaving the ontology; this is the fourth step on it.
  [0003](0003-ontology-growth-loop.md) is the loop exploration joins, with a schema as the
  corpus. [0021](0021-a-rule-reads-attributes-and-concludes-a-type.md),
  [0030](0030-a-rule-may-read-what-a-rule-concluded.md) and
  [0032](0032-a-rule-computes-what-it-concludes.md) are the rules a definition becomes;
  0032's refusal of aggregation over the graph is what makes the database the place a
  definition runs. [0018](0018-the-lakehouse-is-one-protocol-away.md) is why a conversion
  cannot be SQL text. The measuring benches that found this: #501, #503, #520.

## The problem

Exploration builds ontology. It should align to one.

What it builds is the wrong kind of thing. `Metric` and `Dimension` are not classes of
things in the world; they are BI vocabulary for *kinds of column*. The world has orders,
customers and shops. "GMV" is not something that exists; it is an aggregate over an
attribute of orders under a business convention. Making it an entity puts a thing on the
graph that stands for nothing, and 0009, 0010 and 0011 spent three records removing exactly
that species — `concept`, `related_to`, `mapped_to` — from the ontology on the grounds that
they were control flow. The two classes here are the same species, admitted through
`ensure_concept_types` without a proposal, without a person, and (until #231) without even
being noticed.

Three things then have nowhere to live, and the benches measured each:

- **A convention.** "Amounts are in cents; test orders are excluded; an order counts at
  status 2, 3 or 4." Eighteen definitions in the wide corpus share six such sentences. They
  are not an attribute of any Metric, not a field of any mapping row, not a column of
  `knowledge_bases`. With them the model answers 17 of 18 questions; without them, 1 of 18
  (#520). It read every comment and still returned ¥45,992,467 for a GMV of ¥32,931,921,
  because the comments say what a column *is* and nothing says which rows count.
- **An object whose fields sit in several tables.** `(kb_id, concept_id, source)` was meant
  for one number defined two ways; it cannot say that a customer's tier is in the order
  table and their name in the CRM. There is no key, no join, no class.
- **The connection between the graph and the database.** A concept entity has zero facts
  (`facts_on_it = 0` for all twelve); its relation to `dwd_ord_dtl` exists only in the side
  table. Rules (0021–0032) read facts and cannot see a mapping; chat reads mappings and
  cannot see a rule. Two paths, no seam.

## Dead ends

- **Keep the two classes and stop the extractor from seeing them.** Treats the symptom. The
  column-name entities are the visible half; the invisible half is that `order_amount` is
  still a thing that does not exist.
- **A "conventions" text box on the base, read into both prompts.** Proposed during this
  investigation, and it would move the wide corpus from 6% — the model does read prose.
  Rejected because it is a place to put sentences instead of a place to put the thing the
  sentences describe: a filter on an attribute, a unit on a column. Once those have a home
  the box is redundant, and a box that stays is where the next undocumented convention goes
  instead of into the ontology.

  > **Revised 2026-09-09, after measuring it.** The paragraph above rejected the box on
  > principle and gave no number. The number: a one-page markdown of the six conventions,

  > `search_chunks`, takes the wide corpus from **2/18 to 14/18** (#520). Zero code, zero
  > mappings. That is two-thirds of the gap to the seeded 17/18, and it says the cheap thing
  > should exist — a person needs somewhere to write conventions *today*, and a document
  > already works. What the four misses show is the reason the principle still stands: two
  > of them are the page contradicting itself (its "refund total" counted fully-refunded
  > orders GMV never held; "valid" and "paid" were both defined and the model divided by the
  > wrong one). Prose lets two definitions be written that do not compose; an expression
  > over attributes cannot be. So the order of work follows: a written definition (#562) now,
  > the alignment and rules for what prose cannot make unambiguous. The dead end is not the
  > box; it is the box as the *only* place.
- **Natural-language mappings.** Not executable, therefore not verifiable: the bench cannot
  run "divide by a hundred". Every question re-translates the sentence, and #520's baseline
  is the record of how that goes.
- **SQL text as the definition** (today's `expr` and `sql` columns). Executable and
  verifiable, and wrong on two counts 0032 already made about rule expressions: it binds to a
  dialect (`FILTER (WHERE …)` is Postgres; there are five engines), and it can name a column
  that does not exist, so the error moves from unfillable to undiscovered.
- **Exploration proposing the definitions themselves** (GMV, refund rate). The schema does
  not contain them — 0 of 18 on the wide corpus, and the model said in its own words that it
  was searching for a definition of "valid order" and found none. What it would propose is
  `sum(amt_pay)`: runs, looks right, off by a hundred and includes the test orders. That is
  precisely what automatic confirmation (#504) must never ship.

## Decisions

### 1. Exploration produces an alignment proposal per table

For each table it reads: the class it is a table *of*, the attributes its columns carry, the
relations its foreign keys are, and for each aligned column an expression that turns the
column into the attribute's value. It finds existing classes and attributes first and
proposes new ones only where none fits — 0003's loop with a schema in place of a corpus.

It goes through `ontology_proposals`, which already has the four sections this needs
(`entity_types`, `attribute_types`, `relation_types`, `map_to`), and a person adopts it. **A
table's alignment is adopted or rejected as one thing.** Adopting `Order` while rejecting
every attribute of it is not a decision anyone means to make, so the page does not offer it.
Adoption writes the ontology rows and the alignment rows together.

### 2. Not every column is an attribute, and exploration must say which class each one belongs to

A wide table is several classes flattened into one. The alignment un-flattens it:

| column | is |
|---|---|
| `amt_pay`, `qty`, `ord_st`, `dt_crt` | attributes of `Order` |
| `buyer_id`, `shop_id` | relations, `Order → Customer` and `Order → Shop` |
| `shop_nm`, `prov`, `buyer_lvl` | attributes of `Shop`, `Address`, `Customer`, flattened in |
| `ver`, `etl_dt`, `rmk`, `price_old` | nothing; left out |

This is the judgement #502 was reaching for (a key is not a quantity) with the rest of it:
a key is a relation, a quantity is an attribute, and a flattened column is somebody else's
attribute. It is harder than what exploration does today and it is the whole value of doing
it.

### 3. A conversion is a tree, the same tree as a rule expression

`amt_pay / 100`, `CASE chnl WHEN 1 THEN 'app' … END`, `date_trunc('month', dt_crt)` are
stored as the expression tree 0032 defined — `{attr} | {const} | {op, l, r}` — extended with
the node kinds alignment needs and rules do not yet: a cast, a case, a date truncation. The
extension is driven by corpora, not designed ahead: the wide corpus needs those three, and
the next corpus says what else.

A tree is engine-neutral and is rendered to each dialect at query time. A tree's leaves are
attribute ids, so it cannot reference a column that does not exist; the failure is at save
time, where a person is looking.

**Input may be text.** 0032 allowed "a box that parses into this same tree", and this is
the case for it: a person and a model both write `amt_pay / 100` more readily than they
compose it from pickers. `sqlparser` is already a dependency (the read-only gate in
`query_engine` uses it); it parses the text into the tree, and what it cannot parse into a
supported node is refused. What 0032 forbade — storing the string and evaluating it at run
time — stays forbidden.

The natural-language column stays, as explanation: `summary` is what a reviewer reads and
what the chat prompt quotes. The tree is the definition, the sentence is the description,
and neither replaces the other.

### 4. A definition is a rule over aligned attributes, and a person writes it

GMV is `sum(Order.paid_amount) where Order.is_valid`. It is not an entity and not a row in
a mapping table; it is a rule of the kind 0021 built and 0032 made computable, over
attributes the alignment made real. Exploration prepares the attributes; it does not propose
the rule (dead ends, above).

A convention that many definitions share is **one rule that the others read** (0030):
`Order.is_valid ← status ∈ {paid, shipped, done} ∧ ¬is_test`, written once, inherited by
GMV, net sales, order count, refund rate. This is where "test orders don't count" lives — a
condition on an attribute, with a name, that a person wrote and can change in one place.

The unit conversion lives on the alignment (`amt_pay / 100`), and the attribute carries the
unit (`relation_types.unit = 'CNY'`). 0032 noted that nothing checks units when an
expression is written; this record gives units a place to come from, so that check has
something to read.

### 5. `Metric` and `Dimension` retire; `concept_mappings` becomes derived

`ensure_concept_types` goes. No exploration inserts a class without a proposal.

`concept_mappings` is not dropped: its status, revisions, audit stream and page (0011 §2–3)
are the review flow this record still needs. What changes is where a row comes from. Today a
row is the definition; after this, a row is **rendered** from an alignment and a rule — the
rule, the table it aligns to, the column expressions, the source's dialect — into the `sql`
it holds now. The bench (#501, #520) reads the same table it reads today and scores the same
way. A row that a person edited by hand and a row that was rendered are distinguishable,
because a rendered one names the rule it came from.

### 6. Cold start: exploration proposes the class it cannot find

A new base has no `Order`. Exploration proposes it, through the same proposals and the same
adoption, which is the difference from today: `ensure_concept_types` writes; a proposal
waits. A base on an ontology pack (0008) will more often find `Order` already there and
align to it, which is the case this record is written for.

### 7. The schema document is a search corpus, not a source of facts

Ingesting a schema as markdown gives chat something to retrieve (`search_chunks` finds the
table). Extracting it as if it were prose is what produced twenty-eight column-name
entities. The document keeps its place in retrieval and leaves the extraction path. This is
the one decision here that is a bug fix and can land on its own.

## Open questions

- **Where a rule over aligned attributes runs.** 0032 refused aggregation on the graph
  because the graph is open-world and a sum asserts completeness. A database table is
  closed-world: the table *is* all the rows, so `sum(Order.paid_amount)` is an honest
  statement there. The alignment therefore gives a rule a place it can legitimately be
  summed — but that place is another executor, translating the tree and the rule to a
  dialect and running it at the source. Whether to build that, or to stop at rendering
  `concept_mappings` rows for chat to use, is the largest decision this record does not
  make. Today the two paths (documents → facts → rules; database → schema document → model
  writes SQL) are separate, and this record only says where the seam would be.
- **Matching a column to an existing attribute.** By name? By sampled values (#502)? By
  asking the model to say, with the attribute list in the prompt? The wide corpus, where
  `amt_pay` must land on `Order.paid_amount` and `buyer_lvl` on `Customer.tier`, is the test.
- **What the tree needs beyond four operators**, and whether `case` over a code column is
  a conversion (alignment) or a dimension (a rule that names groups). The wide corpus has
  both readings of `chnl`.
- **The page.** How a person reviews a table's alignment, edits one column's expression,
  and sees which rules a change reaches. Capability first, interface after, as usual.
- **`derived`** on `concept_mappings` (0011 §1) was for "conversion rate = orders / visits".
  Under this record that is a rule reading two rules, and the flag has no meaning. It is
  kept until the rendering exists and dropped with the migration that consolidates it.

## What this does to 0011

0011's argument stands: a mapping is not an assertion about the world; it is configuration;
it lives outside the ledger and may be edited in place. This record accepts all of that and
changes one thing 0011 did not decide but its implementation assumed — that the *concept* a
mapping hangs from is an entity of a class called Metric. The concept is an attribute of a
real class, or a rule over such attributes, and the mapping is how a column becomes that
attribute's value.
