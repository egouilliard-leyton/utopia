# 0020 · An auditor reads it without us

- **Status**: implemented · `GET /api/v1/kbs/{id}/export?format=turtle|jsonld` streams the base as RDF; `rdf.rs` holds the mapping, `oxrdfio` the serialisers · SPARQL is still not here, and this record says why it can wait
- **Written**: 2026-09-05 (conventions in the [README](README.md))
- **Related**: [0001](0001-ontology-import-and-governance.md) kept the imported file verbatim and projected what today's consumers can use — this is the first consumer pointing the other way. [0015](0015-recording-a-sentence-is-not-asserting-a-fact.md) and [0019](0019-the-second-clock-can-be-rewound.md) are what makes the export worth reading: the intervals and the lineage are the content, not the triples

> `owl_import.rs` reads OWL in and five packs ship inside the binary. Nothing went the other way. The data an auditor asks for is all on disk — facts carry validity, evidence points at documents and versions, the ledger records who and when — and it could only leave in the shapes the REST API happened to expose.

## Who this is for

Not another Utopia. A regulator, an auditor, or the team's own graph tooling: someone who has a triple store and a question about a decision that was made, and who should not have to learn our JSON to answer it. That fixes what the export must carry — **the intervals and the lineage**, not just the current edges — and it fixes the failure mode: an export that reads as a clean, confident graph while dropping the fact that half of it was retracted in March is worse than no export.

## Identity

**Revision 2026-09-11 ([#601](https://github.com/deeplethe/utopia/pull/601),
[#603](https://github.com/deeplethe/utopia/issues/603)).** This record originally
described the RDF mapping without explicitly stating its compatibility boundary.
#601 added that clarification and structured MCP reads sharing the ledger UUIDs,
restored the premise links already described under Lineage, and documented the
remaining gaps: conflict/review state, chunk identity behind quotes, and historical
proof snapshots. The documented MCP field policy is now explicit too: removing or
renaming a documented `structuredContent` field requires a decision record; clients should
tolerate additional fields.

The RDF mapping is the supported external machine-readable read contract
(clarified in [#550](https://github.com/deeplethe/utopia/issues/550)). A breaking
change needs a decision record explaining why; the internal tables and UI API
shapes are not that boundary. MCP may return the same UUIDs alongside its prose
so a caller can join an agent result to this export. The user-facing contract is
documented in [Agents over MCP](../../web/src/docs/mcp.md#the-external-read-contract).

Classes and relations that came in from an import **keep the IRI they came with**. A base built from the schema.org pack exports `schema:Organization`, not a Utopia mint of it, so the file lines up with the vocabulary the reader already has. That is the payoff for having stored `iri` on `entity_types` and `relation_types` since the first import.

Everything else is minted under a base namespace: entities, documents, and one IRI per fact. Facts get their own IRI rather than blank nodes because a statement someone may have to cite has to be addressable, and because `supersedes` needs somewhere to point. A class or relation the ontology grew itself is minted from its **key** rather than its uuid — the key is what the base already uses as its identifier (`UNIQUE (kb_id, key)`, and it is what the extraction prompt and the API speak), so the file stays readable; a rename is the one event that moves such an IRI, and renaming a class is rarer than reading the export.

The default namespace is a URN — `urn:utopia:kb:{kb_id}:entity:{uuid}` — and `?base=https://…/` overrides it for a deployment that publishes at a known address. The default is stable rather than dereferenceable, which is the right way round: two exports of the same base a year apart must line up, and a self-hosted deployment does not know its own public URL. Minting from the request's `Host` header would have made identity depend on which proxy the exporter came through.

## Intervals ride on the statement, not the triple

A triple cannot say "until July 2024". The three ways to fix that:

| | Why not |
|---|---|
| RDF-star (`<< s p o >> :validFrom …`) | The natural shape, and the one most consumers still cannot parse. A file nobody can load is not an export |
| A named graph per fact | Legal in TriG and JSON-LD, absent from Turtle, and it turns a base into tens of thousands of graphs. Tooling that groups by graph becomes unusable |
| RDF 1.1 reification | Verbose, universally understood, and needs no feature flags |

Reification wins on the only criterion that matters here — the file has to open in whatever the reader already runs.

So every fact appears as an `rdf:Statement` carrying `schema:validFrom` / `schema:validThrough` (world time), `prov:generatedAtTime` / `prov:invalidatedAtTime` (record time), its confidence, and its evidence. **Standard terms wherever they exist**: PROV-O's `invalidatedAtTime` means exactly what our recording axis means, and reaching for a custom term there would hide a familiar concept behind a private name. Three things have no standard spelling and get a minted one: `confidence`, `derived`, and the model's original wording for a predicate the ontology never accepted.

Facts **currently held and currently valid** are additionally written as the plain triple. A consumer that ignores reification then gets a correct present-tense graph rather than an assertion that Zhang San still runs a project he handed over in 2024. Everything else — closed intervals, retracted rows, corrections — is in the file exactly once, as a statement, where the dates are impossible to miss.

## Lineage is PROV-O because that is what PROV-O is

Each statement is `prov:wasDerivedFrom` the documents its evidence chunks belong to, and carries the quoted sentence. Documents are `prov:Entity` with their title and the source key they arrived under. Derived facts ([0002](0002-reasoning-engine.md)) are `prov:wasGeneratedBy` the rule that produced them, with `prov:used` on each premise statement, so a reader can walk from a conclusion to the sentences underneath it without our API — which is the sentence in the README that this record exists to make true.

One of the five built-in packs is PROV-O, so a base that has it loaded already knows these terms.

## What is not here

- **Conflict/review state and chunk identity behind a quote.** Quotes and source
  documents are exported, but these are separate gaps; conflict state is tracked
  in [#564](https://github.com/deeplethe/utopia/issues/564).
- **Historical proof snapshots.** Premise links can be rewritten when a conclusion
  is reproved. The record-time lifetime survives; earlier versions of the proof
  do not (0019). RDF's `prov:used` edges identify premises, not their sequence.

- **A SPARQL endpoint.** The escape hatch over an in-memory Oxigraph projection was the original plan and stays a later cut. Someone who asked for "the reasoning behind this decision" wants a file they can keep; a query endpoint is the second thing they ask for, not the first.
- **Import of our own export.** The export is not a backup format, and reading it back would need entity resolution to be told "these IRIs are already resolved". Nothing stops it later; nothing depends on it now.
- **A button.** The API is the deliverable; where the download lives in the interface is a separate cut.
