# 0053 · A phrase decision records the inputs it considered

- **Status**: implemented 2026-09-23 in PR #878 · `phrase_bindings.basis` (migration 0072), candidates admitted through the class hierarchy and shown to the model as such, structural outcomes recorded instead of skipped, the requeue condition reads live signatures only · closes the lifecycle half of #807 and the phrase half of #795; the kind-word aligner keeps its timestamp staleness for now

## Problem

A phrase signature is decided once and cached; the cache is only right while the inputs that
produced it hold. Until now "the inputs" were identified by timestamps: a bound signature went
stale when its property was updated after the decision, a negative one when any property in the
base was added or updated. #807 and #795 showed four things timestamps cannot see:

1. **Inheritance.** Candidates were properties whose declared domain and range contained the
   endpoint class itself. A property declared on `legal_entity` was never a candidate for an
   `organization` signature, so a correct binding was structurally impossible, and no edit to the
   property would ever make it stale, because the property was never considered.
2. **Parent edges.** Adding `organization ⊂ legal_entity` can turn "no candidate" into a
   candidate; removing it can take the support from a bound signature. `entity_type_parents`
   carries no timestamp and no decision was tied to it.
3. **Edits during the request.** A definition changed while the model was answering commits before
   the decision does, so the decision's `decided_at` is later than the edit and nothing is stale,
   although both votes read the old definition (#795, reproduced with a scripted model).
4. **Two silences.** A signature with no candidate was skipped, never recorded: a previously bound
   signature whose property stopped fitting kept its typed projection. A signature with more than
   `CANDIDATE_LIMIT` candidates was also skipped, and since `stale` kept returning it, it queued a
   run every time without ever becoming executable. Worse, a signature whose endpoint class changed
   left an orphan row behind that `stale` returned forever (three rounds, one job each, in the
   review of #801).

#801 fixed the first and part of the fourth locally and was withdrawn by its author: the
interactions between signature identity, cached decisions, ontology changes and scheduling needed a
design, not another patch.

## Decision

**A decision stores a fingerprint of what it considered, and staleness is "the fingerprint of the
current inputs differs".** The fingerprint (`basis`) covers the ancestor closure of both endpoint
classes, whether the object is a value, and the set of candidate properties admitted through that
closure with each one's `updated_at`. The worker recomputes it for every live signature on every
run and compares it with the stored one. Nothing is compared to a clock.

This answers the four gaps at once. Inheritance changes the closure. A parent edge changes the
closure. An edit during the request changes a candidate's `updated_at`, so the stored fingerprint,
computed before the model was called, no longer matches at the next run: the decision remains
detectably stale exactly as #795 asked. And the two silences become recorded outcomes with their
own reasons, so they participate in staleness like any other decision.

**Candidates are admitted through the class hierarchy, and the model is told why.** `fits` walks
the ancestor closure; when a property fits only through an ancestor, the candidate line says
`fits by inheritance: organization is a subclass of legal_entity` and the system prompt says that
this is a fit. Widening the candidates in code without showing the basis made the model answer
null (#801's finding).

**Structural outcomes are decisions.** No admissible property: `none` with
`votes.reason = "no_candidates"`, which lets materialisation retire a projection whose support is
gone. More than the limit: `undecided` with `reason = "too_many_candidates"` and the count, which
puts it in the alignment queue for a person and stops it from requeueing. Both carry the
fingerprint, so a property added or removed reopens them like any other negative.

**The requeue condition reads live signatures only.** A run queues another run when a batch failed,
when a live signature has no decision and was not attempted, or when a live agent decision's
fingerprint no longer matches. An orphaned row (its signature moved because an endpoint class
changed) has no live signature and is never consulted; its typed rows retire through the ordinary
materialisation rule that a statement's current signature must be bound. Unchanged inputs
therefore leave no queued work.

**A person's decision is not fingerprinted.** It is never re-evaluated by the agent, so it carries
no basis; the human-precedence rule in `decide_on` is unchanged. A person-bound signature whose
property stops fitting keeps its projection: the person said so.

## Not doing

- Fingerprinting the kind-word aligner. #795's reproduction is on `align_types`; the same design
  applies and is the obvious next cut, but its inputs (kind words, class definitions, the
  hierarchy) are a different set and this record does not claim them.
- A revision table of decisions. The old decision is overwritten in place as before; the audit
  ledger keeps the person's decisions and the projection changes. #807 asked what records are
  retained: the answer here is the current decision plus its basis, nothing historical.
- A separate job per signature. One run per base, batched, as before.

## Measurement

Regression coverage, each with a scripted model and a real PostgreSQL: inheritance admits a
property declared on an ancestor and the model sees the basis; removing the parent edge retires the
bound signature's projection without a model call; adding the edge reopens a structural `none`;
overflow is recorded as `undecided` with no model call and no requeue, and shrinking the candidate
set makes it executable again; an endpoint class change orphans the old row without an endless
requeue and decides the new signature; an edit during the model request leaves the decision stale
for the next run; a person's decision made during a request is not overwritten.

The cost is one fingerprint per live signature per run, computed from data the run already loads,
plus one query for property versions. Rows decided before this record have no basis and are
re-decided once.
