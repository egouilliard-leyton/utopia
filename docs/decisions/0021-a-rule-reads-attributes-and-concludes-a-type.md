# 0021 · A rule reads attributes and concludes a type

- **Status**: implemented · all four decisions built and the five phases done (#359) · `derived_facts` widened, `attribute_rules` authored through the ontology page, the evaluator running in the materialisation job, conclusions explained in the entity panel with their premises, and two read-only MCP tools (`list_rules`, `rule_matches`) · writing a rule stays out of MCP, see the open question · a conclusion's own text cannot be edited yet (delete and rewrite), the rule card's entity count is not clickable, and a rule-classified entity carries no canvas marker
- **Written**: 2026-09-05 (conventions in the [README](README.md))
- **Related**: [0002](0002-reasoning-engine.md) built the derivation runner and ruled out a user-defined rule language for ontology axioms; this record adds one narrow rule kind that lives beside the axioms, not inside them. [0009](0009-no-type-is-a-type.md) made `type_id` nullable and a type a considered claim; a rule concludes a *second* type without touching the asserted one. [0015](0015-recording-a-sentence-is-not-asserting-a-fact.md) draws the asserted / derived line this conclusion sits below. From #277.

> A mud-logging user wants a well marked gas-bearing when its total-hydrocarbon reading is above a threshold **and** its interpretation category is "gas anomaly". Both values are already captured as dated attribute facts with the source passage attached. The rule that reads them has nowhere to live: the reasoning engine compiles ontology axioms only, and derivation runs over entity–entity edges, so a literal comparison cannot be expressed and "this well is gas-bearing" cannot be a derived fact with premises.

## What the ground already gives, and what it withholds

Three parts of the machine are reusable as they stand:

- **`fact_derivations`** links a derived fact to its premise facts in order — the proof chain 0002 built. A rule conclusion wants exactly this: the well is gas-bearing *because of* these two readings.
- **Materialisation cadence** — `materialize_inferences`, `inference_interval_minutes`, the invalidate-on-retracted-premise pass — is rule-agnostic. A business rule reruns on the same switch.
- **The asserted-over-derived precedence** — a derived row never overrides an asserted one, and reads that want only ground truth filter `derived_by_rule IS NULL` / skip the `derived_facts` union.

Two parts withhold:

- **`derived_facts` is narrower than `facts`.** `facts` carries either an entity object or a literal (`CHECK (object_id IS NOT NULL OR object_value IS NOT NULL)`); `derived_facts.object_id` and `predicate_id` are both `NOT NULL`. So a derivation today is always an entity–entity edge. Neither conclusion #277 names fits: a derived typing (`Well` → `GasBearingWell`) is a class, not an edge; a derived attribute (`gas_potential = good`) is a literal, not an object.
- **`rules` holds axioms, not conditions.** Its shape is `(predicate_id, kind ∈ {transitive, symmetric})`: one predicate, a closed axiom kind, no place for a comparison. A conjunction of `reading > 12 AND category ∈ {…}` concluding a class has no column to land in.

## Decisions

**1. Widen `derived_facts` to match `facts`, rather than add a parallel table.**

Make `object_id` nullable, add `object_value JSONB`, and copy the `facts` check: `object_id IS NOT NULL OR object_value IS NOT NULL`. A derived attribute (`gas_potential = good`) is then a literal-valued derived fact, and everything downstream — the proof chain, invalidation, the materialisation pass, "drawn as derived on the graph", the `derived_by_rule` precedence — works on it unchanged, because those paths key on the row being in `derived_facts`, not on its object being an entity.

The alternative was a `derived_typings` table plus a separate widening for attributes: two new shapes for the derived reader to learn, where the ground already had one general shape (`facts`) that a rule conclusion is a special case of. The seam this product keeps closing is exactly this one — a half-built parallel path beside a general mechanism (0016's whole premise) — so the mechanism moves, not around it.

**2. A derived typing is a derived attribute fact on a builtin `is_a` predicate.**

`Well` → `GasBearingWell` is stored as a derived fact whose predicate is the builtin `is_a` and whose `object_value` names the concluded class (by IRI, so it survives a label edit — see [0009](0009-no-type-is-a-type.md)). It does **not** write `entities.type_id`: that column holds the asserted type, and a rule conclusion is derived, below it (0015). The entity keeps its asserted `Well`; the graph and panel show `GasBearingWell` as a derived overlay that vanishes when the rule stops firing. This is why decision 1 is worth its cost — with a literal-valued derived fact in hand, a derived typing needs no second concept, only a reserved predicate.

**3. Rules live in a new `attribute_rules` table, authored by a person, never proposed by the model.**

Same governance line as the axioms (0002): the reasoning engine's criteria are written, not guessed. A rule row names the subject class it applies to, the conclusion (a class IRI for a typing, or an attribute predicate + value for a derived attribute), and a conjunction of conditions stored structured, not as free text — each condition is `(attribute_predicate, op, operand)` where `op` is one of `> >= < <= in present` and the operand is a number, a number range, or a set of category strings. Authored in the ontology workbench or imported from a file. No arithmetic across entities, no aggregation, no disjunction across attributes of different entities: one entity, its own attributes, one conclusion. A general rule language stays ruled out, for the same reason 0002 ruled it out.

**4. Validity is the intersection of the premise intervals.**

A well with a 2023 reading that fires the rule and a 2025 reading that does not is gas-bearing over the 2023 interval and not over the 2025 one — two intervals across two evaluations, never a single row that flips. The conclusion's `valid_from` is the latest premise `valid_from`, its `valid_to` the earliest premise `valid_to`; an empty intersection fires nothing. Precision follows the coarser premise, on the same `(date, precision)` invariant the facts table keeps. This is the one piece of new temporal logic; the rest is the existing derived-fact lifecycle.

## The evaluator is a second pass, not an extension of `derive()`

`derive()` in `utopia-reason` walks `TimedEdge`s — entity–entity triples — under the axiom set. Attribute facts, with literal values, never enter it, and should not: a comparison against a threshold is a different operation from following a transitive edge. The business-rule pass is its own function in the same crate: for each entity in scope, load its attribute facts, evaluate each rule's conjunction, and emit a `Derived` carrying the satisfying premises and the intersected interval. It runs in the same materialisation job, after `derive()`, so a rule can conclude a typing that a later axiom pass never consumes (axioms are over edges; the typing is an attribute) — the ordering is therefore free of a cycle by construction, which a rule concluding an *edge* would not be. That restriction — conclusions are types or attributes, never edges — is decision 3's `op` set doing double duty, and worth stating plainly.

**Revision, 2026-09-20 (proposed in [0047](0047-a-rule-may-conclude-a-relation.md), nothing built yet).** The paragraph above is now half history. Its claim was that the rule pass is safe because it runs once, after `derive()`, and concludes nothing an axiom can eat. [0030](0030-a-rule-may-read-what-a-rule-concluded.md) already retired the first half: the rule pass is a fixed point of up to `MAX_DEPTH` rounds, and what keeps it safe is that the derivable space is finite rather than that the ordering is acyclic. 0047 proposes to retire the second half too, letting a rule conclude an **edge** that re-enters `derive()` in the next round, on the same finiteness argument. What stays true from this paragraph is the sentence about the two operations being different — a threshold comparison and a transitive walk remain separate reasoners, and 0047 couples them by the pool they share rather than by folding them into one.

## Phasing

1. **Schema** — widen `derived_facts` (decision 1), the builtin `is_a` predicate (decision 2), `attribute_rules` and its condition rows (decision 3). One migration per the domain-file rule; folded per [[migration-policy]] after main.
2. **Declaration** — store/read for `attribute_rules`, and the ontology-workbench surface to author one (subject class, conditions over its attributes, conclusion). File import can follow.
3. **Evaluation** — the second pass in `utopia-reason`, wired into the materialisation job; interval intersection; invalidate-on-retracted-premise already generalises.
4. **Explanation** — the entity panel shows the rule and each premise fact pointing back to its passage; the graph draws the derived typing as derived.
5. **Acceptance** — the #277 sample: define the two attributes and the rule, upload the report, the well appears as `GasBearingWell` with both readings as its explanation; lower the threshold below the reading and it clears on the next run; the interval matches the report's date.

## Dead ends

- **Writing `entities.type_id` from a rule.** It would put a derived conclusion where the asserted type lives, so a retracted premise would have to restore the prior asserted type — reconstructing ground truth from a derivation, which 0015's line forbids. The overlay avoids it.
- **A general rule DSL.** 0002 already walked this road for axioms and turned back; #277 is explicit that the scope is one entity's own attributes. A DSL would be built for a generality no one asked for and would reopen "the model writes the criteria".

## Open questions

- **Does a derived typing feed the extraction prompt or the mapping probe?** Those read the ontology's classes; a well that is derived-`GasBearingWell` is not asserted to be one. Leaning no — a derivation is a read-time overlay, not a fact the ontology teaches back into extraction — but a rule that concludes a class the corpus then reinforces is a loop worth watching.
- **Category conditions and language.** `interpretation_category ∈ {"气测异常", "气测异常后效"}` is text matched literally. If the same category arrives in English from a different source, the set misses it. Out of scope here; the mapping layer (0011) is where a category vocabulary would belong.
- **One conclusion per rule, or several.** #277 says one. A report that sets both a typing and a `gas_potential` grade from the same two readings would want two rules over the same premises today; whether that is a nuisance is a question the sample will answer.
- **Should an agent ever write a rule?** Reading is settled and built: `list_rules` and
  `rule_matches` are exposed over MCP, and `entity_facts` returns conclusions marked with the
  rule that reached them, so an agent explains a classification from the criteria instead of
  re-deriving it from the readings with a threshold it guessed. Writing is deliberately not
  exposed. The line 0002 drew is against the model *inventing* criteria, and a person
  dictating a rule to their agent is not that — but a tool call cannot tell the two apart,
  and the audit would read as the person's own token either way. A rule is also heavier than
  a fact: one wrong rule re-decides the whole base on every materialisation pass, quietly.
  If this opens later, it wants a pending queue of the shape `pending_facts` has, so a person
  nods before a rule takes effect.
- **A canvas marker for a rule-classified entity.** A conclusion is a judgement about one
  entity rather than a connection, so it draws no edge, and today it is visible only in the
  panel. Asserted attributes have no marker either, so adding one just for derived ones would
  invert the ground. The real gap the marker was standing in for — "which entities did this
  rule mark" — is answered by `rule_matches`. Revisit when someone reports losing track of a
  marked entity on the canvas, which is also when it will be clear what the marker should say.
- **Where authored rules live for export.** If a deployment's rules are part of its ontology, RDF export (#308) has to say how — a rule is not an OWL axiom. Deferred to whenever export lands.
